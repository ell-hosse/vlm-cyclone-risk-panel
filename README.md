# 🌪️ VLM Cyclone Risk Panel

This is a **design mock-up** of a panel for cyclone risk assessments, 
combining building-level imagery (overhead + facade) with contextual data 
(elevation, proximity to coast/trees). 

The goal is to explore how **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)** and **XAI** 
can make risk assessments more transparent and useful for non-experts.
